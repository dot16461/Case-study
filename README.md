## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- OpenAI API key (or compatible AI service)

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dot16461/Case-study.git
cd case-study
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```env
VITE_PUBLIC_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**Note**: The application currently uses Z.AI API (GLM-4.6 model) but can be easily configured for OpenAI GPT API.

### 3. Run the Application

```bash
# Development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

The project follows Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture:

```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app/                 # Application configuration and providers
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pages/               # Route components
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ widgets/             # Complex UI blocks (ApplicationWizard)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/            # Business features (HelpMeWrite)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ entities/            # Business entities (Application, GPT)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/              # Shared utilities and components
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ styles/              # Global styles
```

### Key Components

- **ApplicationWizard**: Main multi-step form component
- **HelpMeWrite**: AI-powered text generation feature
- **LanguageManager**: Multi-language support with RTL
- **Form Components**: Reusable form fields with validation
- **Accessibility Hooks**: Focus management and screen reader support

## ü§ñ AI Integration Setup

### Current Implementation

The application uses Z.AI API with the GLM-4.6 model. To switch to OpenAI:

1. Update `src/entities/gpt/api/gpt.api.ts`:
```typescript
const url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions";
const model = "gpt-3.5-turbo";
```

2. Update your `.env` file with OpenAI API key:
```env
VITE_PUBLIC_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key
```

### AI Features

- **Smart Prompts**: Context-aware text generation for financial situations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of API failures and timeouts
- **User Control**: Accept, edit, or discard AI suggestions
- **Accessibility**: Screen reader announcements for AI interactions

## üåê Multi-language Support

### Supported Languages

- **English (en)**: Default language
- **Arabic (ar)**: Full RTL support with proper text direction

### Language Files

- `src/shared/lib/i18n/resources/en/common.json`
- `src/shared/lib/i18n/resources/ar/common.json`

### Adding New Languages

1. Create new language file in `resources/[lang]/common.json`
2. Update `APP_CONFIG.supportedLanguages` in `app.config.ts`
3. Add language option to `LanguageSwitcher` component

## ‚ôø Accessibility Features

### Implemented Accessibility Features

- **ARIA Roles**: Proper semantic markup for form elements
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support for all interactions
- **Focus Management**: Automatic focus handling between steps
- **Screen Reader Support**: Announcements for form state changes
- **High Contrast**: Material-UI theme with accessibility considerations
- **Form Labels**: Proper labeling for all form inputs

### Testing Accessibility

- Use screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
- Test keyboard-only navigation
- Verify color contrast ratios
- Check ARIA attributes with browser dev tools

## üì± Responsive Design

### Breakpoints

- **Mobile**: < 600px
- **Tablet**: 600px - 960px  
- **Desktop**: > 960px

### Mobile Optimizations

- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Optimized form layouts
- Swipe gestures for step navigation
- Mobile-specific validation messages

## üîß Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
npm run dev          # Start development server
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run preview      # Preview production build
```

### Code Quality

- **TypeScript**: Strict type checking enabled
- **ESLint**: Code linting (if configured)
- **Prettier**: Code formatting (if configured)

### File Structure

- **Components**: PascalCase with `.tsx` extension
- **Hooks**: camelCase with `use` prefix
- **Types**: PascalCase with `.types.ts` extension
- **Utils**: camelCase with descriptive names

## üöÄ Deployment

### Build Process

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

### Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set in production:

- `VITE_PUBLIC_API_KEY`: Your AI API key


## üìù API Integration

### Mock API

The application includes a mock API (`src/shared/api/mockApi.ts`) for development and testing. Replace with real API endpoints for production.

### Form Submission

The application submits form data to a mock endpoint. Update the submission logic in `ApplicationSubmission` component for production use.

## üîí Security Considerations

- API keys are stored in environment variables
- Form data validation prevents malicious input
- No sensitive data is logged to console
- HTTPS should be used in production
